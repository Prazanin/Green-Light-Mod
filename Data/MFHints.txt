Some hints:

You can abandon the morphling vehicle for the time being and 
join your main forces to fight together. United we stand...

It's better to spread out your units when fighting 
bazooka or mortar troops.

If you want your unit not to mess up in combat, put it aside and 
switch it to "hold position mode" (press "H").

If you wish you can try to bring Russians and Arabians in contact 
each other.

                                                               More luck next try...
